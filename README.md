# Project Overview

This Android project was an experimental attempt I made between 2021 and 2022 to create a Clubhouse-style app, focused on regional/local communities across India. However, after about a week of development, I realized the operational costs were too high for me to sustain. The app used the Agora SDK for live audio streaming, which contributed significantly to the cost. Due to this, I decided to remove the app from the Play Store.

That said, I still have the complete Java codebase for the app. I believe it was built using Gradle 6 or 7 back then.

# Tech Stack

I used the following technologies while developing this app:

- Parse Server (now Back4App) – for backend services
- Firebase – for OTP-based user authentication
- Agora SDK – for live audio streaming
- Java – for Android development
- Progaurd - For obfuscation of code in abb
- Mapbox – to display ongoing conversations on a map, similar to Snapchat's location-based stories

& lot more


# Current Status

At the moment, I don’t have any active plans to continue this project, as I’m occupied with other things. However, if I ever get support or funding to monetize it, I’d definitely love to give it another shot. The app was built to display a list of ongoing conversations based on your current location, and you could also explore audio discussions happening in other areas by interacting with the map.

I’ve uploaded the code to GitHub mainly for version control and backup purposes. I might open source it in the future to encourage community collaboration, but for now, there’s no active development going on. If anything changes, I’ll update it here.

Current Code Issues
The main problem right now is compatibility with newer Gradle versions. Since this project is around two years old, some dependencies (like Butterknife) are either deprecated or no longer maintained. I need to refactor the code to replace these outdated libraries and resolve Gradle version conflicts in order to bring the project up to date.
